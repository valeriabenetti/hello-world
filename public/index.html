    <h1> What are my thoughts about the history of the web?</h1>
    <p>After reading the article about the brief history of web design,
    it came clear that it is all but an experiment for artist. With the begining of web design being a trial and error and expanding the ability to make the web
    look how you want it. The future of web design could go even furthur than any can even
    imagine.</p>
    <p>Since the begining of web design up until the start of the 2000's it has
      been fairly a simple use of HTML and CSS to create webpages. As we progress
      into the future more and more people would rather have images than words
      when they search for items. Also I did notice that in both the newline homework info and the article had sentence errors. </p>
